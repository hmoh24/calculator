Coding at this stage has become much smoother and this project took me considerably less time compared to the etch and rock, paper, scissors projects. This is due to a much more familiar relationship with the methods and techniques used to create these sort of web projects.

One thing to note is that at this stage, I am not comfortable with how 'clean' my code is. Despite attempting to learn about clean code, it is clear to me that there are limitations of the functional programming approach used in my previous few projects. At this stage I am not familiar with object oriented programming, but what little I have seen shows that it is a more elegant way to create these sort of projects, at least in my eyes. I am excited to learn and this project has been useful in boosting my confidence in my abilities so far.

I recognise that I could have taken different approaches with my code but I want to leave it like this to see if, when i return to this code in the future, that there are glaring errors and design choices. My prediction is that there will be, and it will be a good litmus test for my capabilities in the future.
